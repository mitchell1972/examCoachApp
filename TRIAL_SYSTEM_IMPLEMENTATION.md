# Trial System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive 48-hour trial system for the Exam Coach App that activates when users complete signup and displays trial status on the dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Trial Activation
- **Trigger**: Trial starts automatically when user completes OTP verification during signup
- **Duration**: 48 hours from signup completion
- **Status**: User status is set to "trial" when activated

### 2. Trial Tracking
- **Start Time**: `trialStartTime` tracks when trial began
- **End Time**: `trialEndTime` calculated as start time + 48 hours
- **Status Checks**: Multiple methods to check trial status

### 3. Trial Display
- **Dashboard Badge**: Shows trial status with appropriate colors and icons
- **Message Format**: "Free trial ends at DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM"
- **Expired State**: Shows "Trial expired" when time has passed
- **Visual Indicators**: Green for active, red for expired, orange for default

## Code Changes

### UserModel (`lib/models/user_model.dart`)
**New Properties:**
- `DateTime? trialStartTime` - Tracks when trial started
- Enhanced trial-related getters and methods

**New Methods:**
- `setTrialStatus(DateTime signupTime)` - Activates trial
- `bool get isOnTrial` - Checks if user is currently on trial
- `bool get isTrialExpired` - Checks if trial has expired
- `DateTime? get trialExpires` - Returns trial expiration time
- `Duration? get trialTimeRemaining` - Returns remaining trial time
- `String? get trialDisplayMessage` - Returns formatted display message

**Enhanced Serialization:**
- Added `trialStartTime`, `isOnTrial`, and `trialExpires` to JSON output
- Updated `fromJson` to handle both `trialEndTime` and `trialExpires` fields

### OTP Verification Screen (`lib/screens/otp_verification_screen.dart`)
**Trial Activation:**
- Added `widget.userModel.setTrialStatus(DateTime.now())` after successful OTP verification
- Added logging for trial activation

### Dashboard Screen (`lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`)
**Enhanced Trial Badge:**
- Dynamic colors based on trial status (green/red/orange)
- Different icons for active/expired trials
- Displays formatted trial message
- Hides badge if no trial data exists

## Test Coverage

### Trial System Tests (`test/trial_system_test.dart`)
**13 comprehensive tests covering:**

1. **Basic Functionality (7 tests):**
   - Trial initialization on signup
   - 48-hour expiration calculation
   - Remaining time calculation
   - Expiration detection
   - JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Users without trial status

2. **Display Formatting (3 tests):**
   - Correct trial expiry message formatting
   - Expired trial message handling
   - No trial message handling

3. **Integration Scenarios (3 tests):**
   - Complete signup-to-dashboard flow
   - Backward compatibility with existing users
   - Trial activation during signup

## User Experience Flow

1. **Signup Process:**
   - User enters phone number
   - User receives and enters OTP
   - **Trial automatically activates** upon successful verification
   - User proceeds to exam/subject selection
   - User reaches dashboard with trial status displayed

2. **Dashboard Experience:**
   - Clear trial badge showing remaining time
   - Formatted expiration date and time
   - Visual indicators for trial status
   - Seamless integration with existing UI

3. **Trial States:**
   - **Active**: Green badge, shows expiration time
   - **Expired**: Red badge, shows "Trial expired"
   - **No Trial**: Badge hidden (backward compatibility)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Trial Duration
- **Duration**: Exactly 48 hours (2 days)
- **Precision**: Down to the minute
- **Calculation**: `signupTime.add(const Duration(hours: 48))`

### Data Persistence
- Trial data stored in UserModel
- Serialized to/from JSON for persistence
- Backward compatible with existing user data

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of users without trial data
- Null safety throughout implementation
- Fallback to legacy behavior when needed

### Logging
- Trial activation logged with timestamps
- OTP verification includes trial logging
- Debug information for troubleshooting

## Testing Results
- **Total Tests**: 39 tests
- **Trial System Tests**: 13 tests
- **Multi-Selection Tests**: 12 tests  
- **Phone Validation Tests**: 14 tests
- **Status**: âœ… All tests passing

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing users without trial data continue to work normally
- Legacy `isTrialActive` method maintained
- Graceful degradation when trial data is missing
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements
- Trial extension capabilities
- Premium upgrade prompts
- Usage tracking during trial
- Trial reminder notifications
- Analytics for trial conversion rates
